## Learn about the Core Economic Features of Space Hunters
*Supply Control & Token Burning*

One of the pillars of the economy is a burn mechanism designed to ensure that both $HCREDIT and $HCASH maintain their value over time. Each time a player uses $HCREDIT (to craft, buy, or upgrade), a portion of it is burned, meaning that the total supply of the token decreases gradually. This is crucial in preventing inflation and maintaining a balanced economy.

Additionally, periodic large-scale burns ensure that any excess circulating tokens are removed from the system. For example, every 45 days, a set percentage of all circulating $HCREDIT is automatically burned, creating a deflationary pressure that increases token value.

**Membership Model and Revenue**
The game’s main revenue source will not be the token itself but rather memberships offered to players. Memberships provide access to extra missions, exclusive items, boosts to $HCREDIT earnings, and more. Memberships are paid with fiat or cryptocurrency but are separate from the token economy, allowing a clear distinction between company revenue and in-game assets.

**Play-to-Earn Model**
While players can earn tokens through gameplay, including $HCREDIT and sometimes even $HCASH, the core focus is on micro-investments made by the community to sustain the economy. The company will provide initial liquidity for the tokens, but the community-driven investments, trades, and token burns will drive the token price.

This model avoids the typical pitfalls of "pay-to-win" mechanics by ensuring that while members gain benefits, free-to-play players can still succeed, though perhaps at a slower pace.

**Balanced Token Flow**
*Earn*: Players primarily earn $HCREDIT through engaging in game missions, staking, guild participation, and daily activity.
*Spend*: They can spend their earned $HCREDIT on a variety of game-improving features like crafting, item purchasing, and staking for passive income.
Burn: Every transaction reduces the circulating supply through burns, increasing scarcity over time.
*Convert*: Conversion from $HCREDIT to $HCASH happens within the game’s ecosystem, enabling governance participation and access to premium content.
*Invest*: Players can reinvest their tokens into staking pools or guild infrastructure, ensuring that token flow is always circulating back into the game.

**Community-Driven Economy**
The economy of Space Hunters is designed to thrive through community participation. Players’ contributions to their guilds, guild wars, the marketplace, and governance votes directly impact how the economy evolves. Community members who hold $HCASH have the power to propose or vote on changes to the tokenomics, ensuring that the game remains a collaborative experience with transparency at every level.

**Final Thoughts**
By incorporating strong burn mechanisms, community participation, and a balanced distribution of rewards, Space Hunters: The Reborn creates a sustainable in-game economy. The balance between free-to-play and pay-to-earn ensures players of all types can engage meaningfully without destabilizing the game's token value. Through strategic use of both $HCREDIT and $HCASH, the game encourages long-term player investment and growth, securing a healthy ecosystem for years to come.

The Space Hunters ecosystem offers free benefits for communities by rewarding interaction and engagement through our $HCREDIT token. Designed for mass adoption, $HCREDIT's purpose is to unite web3 communities, rewarding active members while creating a shared experience. As players interact and engage within their own groups, they also connect with others, building a circle of interconnected communities that all converge in the Space Hunters universe. Communities can promote themselves through our platform, leveraging new features we're developing. After our release, this ecosystem will create a hub for collaboration, growth, and shared success
