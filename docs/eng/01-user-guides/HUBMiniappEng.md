Before diving into our app and exploring all the features available in this version, we want to share a brief summary of our vision. Reading this article to the end will help you better understand our project and maximize your opportunities within it.

## 📲 Why a Mini-App?

![appviews](../../../static/img/APPviews.png)

We have removed the barriers between devices and economic capabilities, offering everyone an app accessible from any device that has the Telegram app installed. In short, HUB is a platform without limitations, democratizing access to our ecosystem.

## 📟 What is HUB and what are its advantages?

![Space Hunters: Reborn](../../../static/img/HUBbannerr.jpg)

Without going into technical details, for us, HUB represents a massive meeting point and a shared experience. All users will be able to connect within a single app, accessing our products and services related to gamer entertainment.

This HUB allows players to manage their web3 gamer profile, with access to all the games they participate in, statistics, inventory, task management, notifications, marketplace, store, and much more. Thus, we save time by avoiding the need to open each game separately to check the progress of your tasks.

In addition, the HUB includes social and daily tasks, where supporting the project is rewarded with our mass adoption token, $HCREDIT. This format is also integrated into the Tech: Generators game, where your social participation becomes a source of monetization.

Our app also features an easy-to-access blog system, where you can read the latest updates and announcements directly from the main screen, simply by tapping on the images or banners.

## ⚙ What is Tech: Generators?
Our app includes Tech: Generators, a Free-to-Play integrated game that transforms social activity in various communities and platforms into a unique monetization experience. Unlike other platforms that impose high requirements for monetization, with Tech: Generators we remove these barriers, allowing all users to earn rewards.

The game converts $HCREDIT into $HCASH through an interactive and cooperative system where the community collaborates to optimize Generators. Some users own generators, while others provide engineers for their operation. Players can enhance generator performance through modules, part crafting, learning unique professions, gaining experience, and much more. This approach turns social monetization into an entertaining experience, eliminating the tedious task of meeting a list of requirements.

## 🪙 How are $HCREDIT generated?

**Now that you know more about HUB, it's time to explore the app. We will guide you step by step through the options and menus to make the most of everything it offers.**

> # 📜 HUB: Step-by-Step Guide

We will explore the different menus available in the HUB Mini-App v1.0, focused on maximizing your experience within the ecosystem. Below, we show you how to navigate through the navigation bar and what options each button offers.

## 🔎 **Navigation Bar (Bottom Menu)**

The bottom menu of the app includes 5 main buttons, designed to facilitate access to the most important features:
![navbar](../../../static/img/menubar1.png)

1. ### 📒 **Catalog:**
In the Catalog button, you will find a complete list of the games, services, and products we have created for the gamer entertainment ecosystem. From here, you can:
- Explore all available games.
- Access additional services and products related to the web3 ecosystem.

2. ### 📑 **Offchain Transactions:**
This button takes you to the Offchain Transactions section, where you can review your transaction history. Here, transparency is key, as you can easily navigate through other users' transactions, providing a completely clear and accessible experience within our hybrid ecosystem.

3. ### 📝 **Daily Tasks:**
In the Daily Tasks section, you will have access to your daily commitments with the Central Command. Completing these daily activities will reward you with significant benefits. Staying active is key to maximizing your rewards and progressing in the ecosystem.

4. ### 🏆 **Top Player List:**
This button takes you to the Top Player List, where you can see the rankings of the most prominent players and guilds in the ecosystem. The ranking is initially based on the amount of $HCREDIT farmed and the total referrals. More information about guild ranking will be included in a future update.

5. ### 🙋‍♂️ **Social Tasks:**
Social Tasks offer an additional way to earn rewards by supporting the project. Initially, rewards will be in $HCREDIT, but over time, features like item drops, experience gains, and other characteristics will be added, allowing you to improve your user profile. As you complete these tasks, you'll unlock new features and expand your experience in the ecosystem, facilitating your personal growth within HUB.

# ✅ Transaction History

This section presents all transactions made, whether they are payments, expenses, or transfers. Additionally, you can navigate to specifically view other users or transactions if the transaction ID is known. There is an option to sort transactions, thus facilitating movement tracking and ensuring transparency among community members.

- **Swap:** Allows you to make exchanges in a game pool (Upcoming functionality).
- **Peer-to-Peer:** Option to make direct transactions between users with a minimal service fee. However, this option carries risks, so it is recommended to use it only with known users or friends.

The search bar lets you go directly to a specific user or transaction.
